- JunoDB is KV store designed, build, and opensoursed by PayPal
- iT powers key services @paypa;
	- login
	- risk management
	- transaction processing
- Key highlight
	- efficiently store and cache data
- key impact
	- reduces load on relational DB
	- reduces load on downstream services
	- reduces # calls to downstream services
	- reduces # calls to expensive databases  (joins, aggregations, etc)

- Language of implementation
	- It started as a single threaded C++ program but got re-written in Go     ---> similar to Redic (c) 
		- Highly concurrent --> Goroutines (>> pthreads)
		- multi-core friendly
 - JunoDB is well suited for CPU heavy workloads
- Availability
	- JunoDB provides six 9s ~99.9999% of availability whicj means a downtime of just 31.56 seconds in one year
- Scale 
	- JunoDB handles 350B requests everyday ^8da2bd
-  Common Use cases
	- Caching --> JunoDB is often used in temporary cache 
		- TTC from few seconds to few days
		- user tokens --> no need to hit DB (auth) on every request
		- account details --> no need to fetch account details every time
		- API response --> no need to recompute responses every time
		- user preference --> e.g., transaction list, recent activity
			- notification preferences
	- Idempotency --> avoid duplicate processing
		- retries are painful
		- we should not reproduces the request in case of  retries 
			- no reprocess of payment
			- no re-sending notification 
	- Latency bridging
		- JunoDB has really fast inter-cluster replication
		- [[JunoDB.excalidraw#^9kVBK3jI]]
		- Because of the instant replication JunoDB provides near-consistent reads
		- How does this help ? 
			- PayPal uses Oracle ass its primary database
			- they have active-active setup across database
			- [[JunoDB.excalidraw#^vQPD67Cc]]
			- Because of this replication log, reads going to different DC might fail
