### 1. Identifying Components:
The lite version of Chingari on Aptos will include the following components: 
-	User Interface (UI): This will be the main interface for users to interact with the app. It will include features such as a news feed, video streaming, and other interactive elements. 
-	Backend Server: This will be responsible for handling user requests and providing data to the UI. It will also store user data and manage authentication. 
-	Database: This will store all of the user data and content that is used by the app. 
-	Content Delivery Network (CDN): This will be responsible for delivering content to users quickly and efficiently. 
- Analytics Platform: This will provide insights into user behavior and usage patterns, allowing Chingari to optimize its services accordingly.

### 2. Designing System Architecture: 
The system architecture for Chingari’s lite version on Aptos should be designed in such a way that it can scale easily as more users join the platform. The architecture should also be secure, reliable, and efficient in order to provide a good user experience. Here is an example of how this could be achieved: 
- The UI would be built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript technologies in order to provide a responsive design that works across different devices and platforms. 
-  The backend server would use NodeJS as its primary language in order to handle requests quickly and efficiently. It would also use MongoDB as its database technology in order to store user data securely.
- The CDN would use Amazon CloudFront or Akamai in order to deliver content quickly and reliably across different regions of the world. 
-  The analytics platform would use Google Analytics or Mixpanel in order to track user behavior and usage patterns over time.


### 3. How it Works:
Once all of these components are set up, they can work together seamlessly in order to provide an optimal experience for users on Chingari’s lite version on Aptos. 
When a user opens the app, they will see a news feed populated with content from various sources (e.g., videos). As they scroll through this feed, their interactions with it (e.g., likes/dislikes) are tracked by the analytics platform so that Chingari can better understand their preferences over time.

When they click on a video or article, it is delivered quickly via the CDN so that they can start watching/reading right away without any delays or buffering issues. Finally, all of their interactions with the app are stored securely in MongoDB so that Chingari can provide personalized recommendations based on their past behavior within the app itself or through other channels (e.g., email).

Chingari is a popular Indian short video sharing app that has gained a lot of popularity recently. To cater to users who may have low-end devices or limited data connectivity, the company has launched a "lite" version of the app that is optimized for such scenarios. In this architecture flow, we will design the system architecture for Chingari's lite version on Aptos.

Components of Chingari's Lite Version:

1.  User Interface: The user interface (UI) is the primary component of the Chingari lite version. The UI must be simple, intuitive, and easy to navigate to cater to users who may have low-end devices or limited data connectivity.
    
2.  Content Management System: The content management system (CMS) is responsible for managing the content on the app. It includes features such as content creation, editing, and publishing. It also includes features such as content discovery and curation.
    
3.  Analytics: Analytics is a crucial component of any app. It helps the developers to understand how users interact with the app and identify areas for improvement. The analytics component includes data collection, analysis, and visualization.
    
4.  Networking: Networking is a crucial component of any app that relies on online connectivity. It includes features such as data synchronization, offline support, and network optimizations to ensure that the app performs well even on low-end devices.
    
5.  Security: Security is an essential component of any app that handles user data. It includes features such as data encryption, user authentication, and access control to ensure that user data is protected.
    

System Architecture:

The system architecture for Chingari's lite version on Aptos will be designed using a microservices architecture. The microservices architecture is a software design pattern that structures an application as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other using APIs.

1.  User Interface: The user interface component will be developed as a single-page application (SPA) using a modern web development framework such as React or Angular. The SPA will communicate with the backend services using APIs.
    
2.  Content Management System: The content management system will be developed as a set of microservices. Each microservice will be responsible for a specific aspect of the CMS, such as content creation, editing, or publishing. The microservices will communicate with each other using APIs.
    
3.  Analytics: The analytics component will be developed as a set of microservices. Each microservice will be responsible for a specific aspect of the analytics, such as data collection, analysis, or visualization. The microservices will communicate with each other using APIs.
    
4.  Networking: The networking component will be developed as a set of microservices. Each microservice will be responsible for a specific aspect of networking, such as data synchronization, offline support, or network optimizations. The microservices will communicate with each other using APIs.
    
5.  Security: The security component will be developed as a set of microservices. Each microservice will be responsible for a specific aspect of security, such as data encryption, user authentication, or access control. The microservices will communicate with each other using APIs.
