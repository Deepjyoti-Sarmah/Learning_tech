- Dopamine
	- The problem with dopamine detoxing
	- Dopamine is rewarding
	- It's not simulation that you want ---> It's the dopamine that the stimulation squirts that you want
	- Dopamine re-sensitization
	- Low sensitivity to reward ---> you need lots of stimulation to capture your attention
	- High sensitivity to reward ---> you need less stimulation to capture your attention 
	- How to calibrate your sensitivity to reward ?
		- take boring breaks
			- Modify how we take breaks
			- dropping the bar
			- lets things simmer
		- Inhabit the inbetween
			- what you did the last time ? 
			- bring yourself to present
			-  just sit quietly
			- your baseline for what's boring will shift
		- Do everything one thing at a time
			- default mode network 
			- task positive network
			- superpower for flow
			- Higher the reward = easier to shift
			- focus one thing at a time
			- once at a time
