- ## Goals
- [x]  web dev/ blockchain
- [x] workout
- [x] hyperledger fabric
- [x] opensource/ eth/ sol /devops
- ### [[zkEVM]]
	- zero knowledge proof + EVM
	- ### What is EVM
		-  Smart contract (program) --> solc compiler -->Bytecode, ABI
		- Bytecode (low-level insstruction) --> EVM
		-  EVM is decentralized virtual machine that executes smart contracts
		- EVM software-based emulation of a physical computer
	- ### Zero Knowlege proof
		-  A zero-knowledge protocol is a method by which one party can prove to another party that something is true, without reveling any infomation apart from the fact that this specific statement is true
	- zkEVM
		- [[zkEVM.canvas]]
	- zkEVM architecture
		- The execution environment 
		- the proving circuit
		- the verifier contract
	- [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JRM3RMytZp2ek0k4WB5X_qbi9_BKXo2-)
	- Is zkEVM has a layer 2 blockchain?
		- zkEVM is a layer 2 scaling solution for etherum
	- Types of zkEVM
- ### leading code #webdev  ^4277aa
	- fixed the view submission issue
	- stylized it

			- Method
			- Status code
			- Headers
			- Body
	- REST / GraphQL
	- Programming language
	- networking / linux fundamentals
		- HTTP , TCP , DB
	- Database (SQL/NO SQL)
	- Caching (Redis / MemCached)
	- Cloud Providers 
		- (GC/ Azur/ AWS)
	- Web Security
	- Containerization
	- testing
- ### [[Backend projects projects]]
	- use Toolkits like Cloudflare stack
		- workers
		- global cdn
		- Build a simple app but deploy it on a very highly optimized stack
	- Real-time communication
		- collabrative text editor
		- work-group chat
		- chat/ audio/video
			- with correct nos. like 100+ people in a single chat room
			- scalability stack
		- Multiplayer game
			- web scokets
	- npm packages
		- rate limiter
		- security module
		- image optimization
	- Make a clone website
		- mini version of codedamn playground
	- CLI toolkit
		- make cli fun and make save time

	-  ctrl + shift + F 
	-  Photo no 1 - eva elfie No 2 - mia Khalifa No 3 - leah gotti No 4 - dani Daniels No 5 - sybil A No 6 - Angela white No 7 - fer se Sybil A No 8 - fer se eva elfie
- ## [[STOP Watching Coding Tutorials Right Now! My LEARNING FRAMEWORK]]
	- Goal driven learning
		- Choose a specific goal
		- Not extreamly ambitious
		- Group of peop
	- Learning before earning
		- Take break if you need to
	- Question driven development
		- Don't drive into tutorials
		- what do they do on a day-today basis
		- break it down into small projects
		- break the project down into small prompts or questions
		- from someone working in the industry
	- Tutoroial hell
		- copying someone else
		- no real world projects
		- muscle memory not knowledge
		- Project based learning
	- Low latency Development
		- Break it down into a small projects
		- build a very simple low latency trading system
		- Written in c, c++, Rust 
			- How websockets servers are written in these languages
			- how data transmission happens
			- how data compression happens
			- How to regionally distribute servers
