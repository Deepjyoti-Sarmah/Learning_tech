	- [x] Rust / solidity
	- [x] blockchain/ web dev/ drone
	- [x] bank work
- ### 8 Common CLI Mistakes Programmers Make
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vitHV8Eor4
	- neglected to update your packages
	- failing to backup data
	- unintentionally overriding your file
	- using sudo too often
	- not knowing how to use options or flags
	- not using git command correctly
	- mistyping your file path
- ### Votting Dapp
	- removed all code and adding new code 
	- added voting script
	- adding deployment script and removing the error

- [[Lesson-1]] solidity
	- hybrid smart contract: on-chain + off-chain agreements
	- chainlink : Decentralized oracle network
	- Dapp= Decentalized application = decentralized protocol = smart contract
	- unbreakable promises
	- A smart contract is an agreement, contract, or set of instructions that is deployed on a decentralized blockchain
		- cannot be altered (immutable)
		- automatically executes
		- everyone can see the terms of the agreement
	- Trust minimized agreements
	- Decentralizes
		- many node operators run blockchains
	- transparency & flexibility
	- speed and efficiency
	- security and immutability
	- counterpart risk removal
	- trust minimized agreements
	- What have smart contract done so far
		- defi
		- Daos
		- NFTs
	- Your first transaction
