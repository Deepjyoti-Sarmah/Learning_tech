Greetings, Hiring Manager

I'm submitting this letter to show my interest in the Hyperledger mentorship role for the aries-vcx next-gen mobile wrapper. I'm enthusiastic about the chance to learn and contribute to the creation of the uniffi_aries_vcx rust crate and mediation client with support for the Aries message pick-up protocol because I'm a dedicated student of blockchain and web3 technologies.

I am confident in my abilities to learn Rust and create a rust wrapper around aries-vcx for mobile settings given my vast programming experience in Solidity, JavaScript, Golang, Java, Python, and C++. I have a comprehensive grasp of smart contracts and how they integrate with front-end frameworks like ReactJS and NodeJS thanks to my projects, such as Creator's Fund and Gassless AI NFTs. Additionally, I have worked on Solana airdrops and decentralised file storage systems, which required me to develop utilising Web3.js, ReactJS, and Solidity.

I am keen to get some first-hand experience with Aries protocols and self-sovereign identities because I am a quick learner. My expertise in blockchain development, along with my background in software engineering, make me a strong contender for this post, in my opinion. In addition, working on the AR-based application Turban-Onn, which won the Smart India Hackathon, gave me a problem-solving methodology that would be useful when working on challenging projects like the Hyperledger - aries-vcx mobile wrapper.

Working with the mediator client and rust crate uniffi_aries_vcx with support for the Aries message pick-up protocol greatly interests me. My knowledge of Linux, Docker, Git/Github, MongoDB/SQL, GoFiber, GorillaMux, and Hardhat, as well as my experience with these technologies, would be essential in helping to build the Hyperledger ecosystem.

Thank you for giving my application some thought. I eagerly await the chance to interact with and help the Hyperledger community.
