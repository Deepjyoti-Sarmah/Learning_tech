	- #### Solana Overview[](https://solang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/targets/solana.html#solana-overview "Permalink to this heading")
		- As the underlying Solana environment is different than that of Ethereum, Solidity inner workings have been modified to function properly. For example, A Solidity contract on Solana utilizes two accounts: a data account and a program account. The program account stores the contract’s executable binary and owns the data account, which holds all the storage variables. On Ethereum a single account can store executable code and data.
	- #### Compute budget
		- On Ethereum, when calling a smart contract function, one needs to specify the amount of gas the operation is allowed to use. Gas serves to pay for a contract execution on chain and can be a way for giving a contract priority execution when extra gas is offered in a transaction. Each EVM instruction has an associated gas value, which translates to real ETH cost. Provided that one can afford all the gas expenses, there is no upper boundary for the amount of gas limit one can provide in a transaction, so Solidity for Ethereum has gas builtins, like `gasleft`, `block.gaslimit`, `tx.gasprice` or the Yul `gas()` builtin, which returns the amount of gas left for execution.
		- On the other hand, Solana is optimized for low latency and high transaction throughput and has an equivalent concept to gas: compute unit. Every smart contract function is allowed the same quantity of compute units (currently that value is 200k), and every instruction of a contract consumes exactly one compute unit. There is no need to provide an amount of compute units for a transaction and they are not charged, except when one wants priority execution on chain, in which case one would pay per compute unit consumed. Therefore, functions for gas are not available on Solidity for Solana. ^6c9de1
