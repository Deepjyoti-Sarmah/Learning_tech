	- follow the fun
	- don't waste time modelling
	- Lesson 1
		- you're learning a  game engine, not a render engine
	- Lesson 2
		- learn one editor at a time
		- Editor --> the basics
			- material graph
			- lighting
			- static mesh editor
		- Editor ---> animation
			- Sequencer
			- Movie render queue
			- skeleton mesh editor
			- niagara
		- At-home virtual camera
			- BMPCC Cage --> simple cage to attach all pieces of hardware
			- Hollyland HDMI --> wireless transmitter to share desktop to monitor
			- HTC VIVE --> send position of the tracked camera into unreal
			- NINJA Monitor --> on-board monitor to review the unreal scene in real time
	- Lesson 3
		- Download sample projects
			- Meerkat demo
			- medeival project
			- slay
			- the matrix
	- Lesson 4
		- Documentation
		- workflow ---> find article showing how all the pieces fit together, once you know how things work, deep-drive each feature/plugin 
		- feature/plug-in ---> press F1 inside of the editor you want to learn, press ctrl+alt and hover over any detail you're unsure about
	- Lesson 5
		- start + finish small projects
		- make 30 small projects
- ### Leetcode clone #webdev  ^fbfbbe
