- ### Goals
- [x] solidity / rust
- [x] web deb/ blockchain/ drone
- #### [[Lesson-1]]
	- [[Lesson-1#^2b6bf2]]
	- transaction fee = gas price * gas used
	- the more people send transactions at the same time the more expensive your gas costs are
	- How blockchain works ?
		- Genesis  block
			- first block in a blockchain
		- Hash 
			- unique fixed length string to identify a piece of data
		- Hash Algo
			- a function that computes data into a unique hash
		- Mining 
			- the process of finding the "solution" to the blockchain "problem"
			- in our example, the "problem" was to find a hash that starts with four zeros
			- nodes get paid for mining blocks
		- Block
			- a list of transactions mined together
		- Decentralized 
			- having no single point of authority
		- Nonce
			- a "number used once" to find the "solution" to the blockchain problem
			- It's also used to define the transaction number for an account/address
		-  Signing Transactions
			- Private key
				- only known to the key holder, it's used to "sign" transactions
			- public key is derived from your private key. Anyone can "See" it, and use it to verify that a transaction came from you
			- Anyone can then verify this new transaction hash with your public key
			- secret phase >>> private key ||||| public address
	- Consensus is the mechanism used to agree on the state of a blockchain
		- chain selection 
			- nakamoto consensus
			- block confirmation
		- sybil resistance
			- Pow
			- PoS --> nodes put up collateral as a sybil resistance mechanism
			- validators
			- pseudo-random chosen
		- 51% attack
		- sybil attack
		- sharding and rollups are scalability solutions
