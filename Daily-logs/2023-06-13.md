- ### [[Miyamoto Musashi - How To Build Your Self Discipline]]
	- Avoid doing things just because they feel good
		- Do not seek pleasure for its own sake
		- Miyamoto knew that greatness had a price, and he needed to pay it, no matter how expensive it was
		- Indulging in pleasure steals time from us
		- Time well spent is when you do  something that matters, and that feeling has no equal
	- Focus on one thing
		- Practice and understand the realization that by knowing one way, you know a thousand
		- Even though Miyamoto learned just one art, he knew how to express it in thousands of ways
		- Your mission to find the path where you'll feel fulfilled will always be in restart mode
		- Give yourself time to truly grasp what's in your hand
		- Do not feel contempt by knowing just the superficial aspect of a discipline ; the beauty of it is ingrained inside
		- We should dedicate our time to one skill and make thousands of ways out of it
	- Stay focused
		- never stray from the way
		- Miyamoto was a man of almost surreal amounts of self-control, determination, and  discipline
		- Prioritized what is useful to you 
			- Taste life in a much deeper way 
		- If you aren't feeling at-least some anxiety or fear then chances are you're not pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone at all
		- Some fear is a good thing --> It's a sign your eyes are fully open
		- With time and discipline, you'll discover the most amazing lost treasures, right infont of you
	- Live with integrity and preserve your honor
		- You may abandon your own body but you must reserve your honor
		- Bushido
			- Set of virtues that one might follow in order to live a moral and noble life
				- Respect
				- Integrity
				- Honesty
				- Honor
				- Courage
				- Compassion
				- Loyalty
		- Honor and discipline are both cut from the same cloth and developing one often leads directly to improving the other
		- Wasting time on punishing yourself is no different to distracting oneself with immediate pleasures
		- Living honorably and living with discipline is the remedy to our greed, covetousness, and selfishness
