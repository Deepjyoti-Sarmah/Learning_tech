	- Make a project plan
	- Talk to your mentors early
	- Get to know code styles and available tools beforehead to avoid back-and-forths during PR review
	- ### Build Solang using Dockerfile
		- First clone the git repo using:
		- `git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/solang`
		- Then you can build the image using: `docker image build .`
	- ### Binary download
		- To download the Solang binary for Linux, follow these steps:
			1.  Go to the GitHub releases page for Solang: [https://github.com/hyperledger/solang/releases](https://github.com/hyperledger/solang/releases)
			2.  Scroll down to the "Assets" section of the release corresponding to your desired version. You'll find the available binaries for different platforms.
			3.  Look for the binary file that matches your Linux architecture:
				-   For x86-64, download the file `solang-linux-x86-64`.
				-   For ARM64, download the file `solang-linux-arm64`.	
			4. Once the file is downloaded, you need to make it executable. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the binary.
			5.  Run the following command to give execution permission to the binary (replace `<filename>` with the actual filename of the downloaded binary):
				-   For x86-64: `chmod +x solang-linux-x86-64`
				-   For ARM64: `chmod +x solang-linux-arm64`
			6.  After setting the execution permission, you can move the binary to a directory included in your system's `$PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin`, to make it accessible from anywhere in the terminal. You can use the following command to move the binary (replace `<filename>` with the actual filename of the downloaded binary):
    
			    -   For x86-64: `sudo mv solang-linux-x86-64 /usr/local/bin/solang`
			    -   For ARM64: `sudo mv solang-linux-arm64 /usr/local/bin/solang`
		- That's it! You should now be able to run the Solang compiler by typing `solang` in your terminal.

- ## [[How to learn by doing]]
	- What is learn by doing ?
		- An approach to learning that exphasises practical hands-on experience over theoretical knowledge .
		- Instead of simply reading, watching, or studyinng about the subject , learners actively engage with the subject matter by working on projects, task or activities that requires them to apply what they have learnt in a real-world context
	- Some benifits of learn by doing approach :
		- increased retension of the information
		- Better understanding of how concepts apply to real-world situation
		- Development of problem-solving and critical thinking skills
		- increased motivation and engagement in the learning process
	- How to learn by doing ?
		- start with a clear goal and choose a project
		- research and gather information about the project and tech stack
		- break the project into smaller , manageable tasks
		- or , plan out the steps you need to take to complete the project or task
		- start working begin working on the project or task. Take small steps and wok through each part of the process. Don't be afraid to make mistakes or try new things 
		- reflect and evaluate after each step
		- seek feedback
		- repeat --> build something new ^766f98
