	- What is web3 ?
		- Web3, or the decentralized internet, is the next step in the evolution of the internet, powered by the blockchain
		- user-centric
		- data-control
		- decentralized authority
		- open transparent 
	- web3 vs web2
		- Ownership and control of data
		- power dynamics
		- fiat and cryppto
	- The social media state in 2023
		- Role of major platform ---> facebook, youtube, twitter etc
		- Centrallized control ---> platform control over data and algorithms
		- Data Ownership ---> User data owned and monetized by platform
		- UX in Web2 Social Media
			- Personalized content (trageted ads)
			- Platform Algorithm
			- Limited Control on Personal database
		- Issues in web2 social media
			- data privacy concerns
			- Lack of Transparency
			- Platform Control (Censorship)
		- Transition to Decentralized social media
			- decentralized control
				- Shift from centralized to decentralized control 
				- user control over data and privacy
			- Blockchain empowerment
				- blockchain's role in decentralized social media
				- transparency, security and user influenced
	-  Social network and social graph ?
		- Social network is a single application 
		- Social graph is the network but also all the connection inside the network
	- Lens Protocols
		- web3 modular social graph on polygon blockchain
		- empower creats to own the LINKS between themselves and their community, forming a composable, user-owned graph
		- Add fixes
		- immutable e content
		- portability
		- The portability issue
			- twitter 9333 followers
			- instagram 3
		- many apps
			- user-owned, open social graph any app can plug into
			- user own their data: they can bring it to any app built on top of lens protocol
			- each app benefits the whole ecosystem
		- Platform control -- Censorship
			- creators donot need to wory about losing everything based on the platform's algorithms and policies
			- Developers can design meaningful social experiences without needing to turn to feedback mechanisms to lock in a user's attention
		- Overview
			- profile: lens profiles
			- user: standard crypto-wallets
			- Built from the ground up with modularity in mind
			- Multisig
		- Lens Protocol -- Profile creation
			- User create a profile
			- User receive an NFT
			- NFT's owner is the profile's controller
		- 3 Composable Tokenization layers
			- LensHub contract: Interactions begin with the profile's NFT
			- FollowNFT contract (followers): deployed upon a profile's first follow, unique to the profile
			- CollectNFT contract (bookmark): deployed upon publication's first collect = collected publication
		- Modules: standalone contracts
			- They adhere to a specific interface and hold state
				- Follow modules: tried to a profile: logic to be executed on a follow's attempt
				- Collect modules: tied to specific publications. logic to be executed on a collect's attempt
				- Reference modules: tied to specifix publications. Logic to be executed on a comment/mirror attempt
		- What can profile owner do ?
			- Set profile image URL
			- Publish to the profile. Post, Comment, Mirror
			- Set the follow module: define logic that must be executed on a follow attempt (add a fee)
		- What can regular wallets do ?
			- Follow profiles: Execute "follow module" logic (if any)
			- Collect publications: Executes "collect module" logic
		- Closing Notes #1
			- Composable, modular social graph protocol
			- It's built to be:
				- community-owned
				- ever-evolving
			- User can decide how they want:
				- there social graph to be build 
				- how they want to monetize (if they want)
		- It's a new paradigm of ownership and customization not possible, or financially feasible in web2
	- Does it have to be on the Blockchain to be decentralized ??
		- "Bluesky" is an initiative to develop a decentralized social network protocol, and an associated social networking service
		- The AT Protocol 
			- A new federated social network
			- simple
			- fast 
			- open
		- Federation
			- A group of computing/network providers agreeing upon standards of operation in a collective fashion
		- Research about it
