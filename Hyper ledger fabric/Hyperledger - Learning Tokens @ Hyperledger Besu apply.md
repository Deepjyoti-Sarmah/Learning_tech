		- Learning Tokens recognize, register, and reward community engagement in collective learning while certifying skills acquisition and individual competencies.
		- In 2021, we did a global directory of DLT/Blockchain learning places. Last year, we defined artifacts for learning tokens, and now we shall code their Smart Contracts for MOOCs.
		- Learning Objectives 
			- Understand the tokenization of learning experiences.
			- Use the Inter Work Alliance Token Taxonomy Framework, IWA-TTF. 
			- Apply IWA Token Designer to create Learning Tokens Templates. 
			- Deploy them in Hyperledger Besu.
			- Understand granular learning interactions in MOOCs.

Greetings, Hyperledger Mentorship Team.

As a student with a keen interest in blockchain and web3, I am thrilled to submit an application for the Learning Tokens @ Hyperledger Besu mentorship project. I'm writing to convey how excited I am about this chance and how much I hope to contribute to the vision that Learning Tokens have for transforming education.

My resume demonstrates that I have experience with a variety of tools and technologies, including Solidity, JavaScript, Golang, Java, Python, and C++, and that I have worked on multiple blockchain projects. I also have knowledge of Linux, Docker, Git/Github, Blockchain, Ethereum, Solana, Hardhat, Chai-testing, ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB/SQL, ERC20, and ERC721. With this background, I am sure I have the technical abilities needed to contribute to the Inter Work Alliance Token Taxonomy Framework and IWA Token Designer to create Learning Token Templates and connect Learning Tokens with MOOCs.

I'm very intrigued by the obstacles of implementing Learning Tokens in Hyperledger Besu, and I'm excited to investigate novel approaches to fusing Learning Tokens with MOOCs. I am aware that much research and analysis may be needed, but I am certain that I am up to the task. Working on the report on linking IWA-TTF to Hyperledger Besu with the mentoring team excites me.

By using creative methods and ideas, I have successfully navigated difficult challenges in my prior undertakings. In the Creator's Fund initiative, for instance, I linked users' wallets to the website so they could give cryptocurrency to the project's founders. Similar to this, I created a decentralised file storage system for the File Storage Dapp project using Solidity and Hardhat for the smart contracts and ReactJS with TailwindCSS for the front-end. I have no doubt that with the help of this experience, I will be able to meet the demands of this mentorship programme and provide workable answers.
I'm excited about this possibility because I'm passionate about blockchain and web 3. By tokenizing learning events and increasing the learning process, Learning Tokens, in my opinion, may transform education. I'm pleased to work with the mentorship team to create creative solutions to the problems associated with deploying Learning Tokens in Hyperledger Besu, and I'm keen to contribute to this ambition.

I appreciate your taking a look at my application. I'm eager for the chance to go into more detail about my experience and excitement.

Sincerely,
Deepjyoti Sarmah
