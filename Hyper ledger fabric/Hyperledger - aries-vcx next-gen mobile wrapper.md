Dear [Mentor's Name],

I am writing to express my interest in your mentorship program. I came across the program on youtube while researching about private blockchain and was immediately drawn to the opportunity to learn from an experienced mentor in the  industry. Your background in [field-specific skills] aligns perfectly with my career aspirations and I am excited about the possibility of working with you to develop my skills further.

As you can see from my attached resume, I have experience in various programming languages such as Solidity, JavaScript, Golang, Java, Python, and C++. Additionally, I have worked on projects related to blockchain and web development using tools like Linux, Docker, Bash Scripting, Git/Github, Ethereum, Solana, Hardhat, Chai-testing, ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB/SQL, ERC20, ERC721, GoFiber, GorillaMux, and more. These experiences have helped me develop a strong foundation in software development and I am eager to build upon them.

One of my recent projects, which I believe aligns with the job description for this mentorship program, was developing a Rust wrapper around Aries-vcx library to enable consuming the library in a mobile setting using a modern FFI approach. Additionally, I implemented an Aries mediator client to unlock full mobile support. Through this project, I learned about self-sovereign identity and Aries protocols, as well as the Rust language and basics of Kotlin language, Android development, Github Actions and CI process, and FFI using uniffi library. The expected outcome of this project includes a rust crate, which generates mobile bindings for the Aries-vcx library, a mediator client with Aries message pick-up protocol support, and a simple Android demo application that can be run in a simulator.

I am confident that this mentorship program will provide me with the guidance and expertise needed to further develop my skills and take my career to the next level. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely, Deepjyoti Sarmah

Dear Hyperledger Mentorship Program,

I am excited to apply for the mentee role in the Hyperledger - aries-vcx next-gen mobile wrapper program. I came across this opportunity through a YouTube podcast about private blockchain and was immediately drawn to the chance to learn from industry experts.

As a passionate student of blockchain and web3 technologies, I have gained experience in Solidity, JavaScript, Golang, Java, Python, and C++, and I am confident that I can quickly learn Rust and successfully implement a rust wrapper around aries-vcx for mobile settings. Through my projects, such as Creator's Fund and Gassless AI NFTs, I have gained a deep understanding of smart contracts and their integration with front-end frameworks like ReactJS and NodeJS.

Additionally, I have experience with tools and technologies such as Linux, Docker, Bash Scripting, Git/Github, Blockchain, Ethereum, Solana, Hardhat, Chai-testing, ExpressJS, MongoDB/SQL, ERC20, ERC721, GoFiber, and GorillaMux, which I believe will be beneficial for this program.

I found out about this mentorship program through a YouTube podcast about private blockchain, and I am interested in it because I want to gain hands-on experience with self-sovereign identity and Aries protocols and contribute to the development of the uniffi_aries_vcx rust crate and mediator client with Aries message pick-up protocol support.

As a mentee in this program, I hope to gain hands-on experience with self-sovereign identity and Aries protocols and contribute to the development of the uniffi_aries_vcx rust crate and mediator client with Aries message pick-up protocol support.

I am a quick learner, and I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow. I have been a part of several projects and experiences that have honed my skills and helped me gain a better understanding of the technology. For instance, my team and I were Grand Finalists in the Smart India Hackathon, Software Edition, where we developed Turban-Onn, an application that displays turban filters covering a person's face in real-time using Augmented Reality.

I believe that my skills and experience make me a suitable candidate for this mentorship program. I am excited about the opportunity to learn and grow under the mentorship of industry experts and contribute to the development of the next-gen mobile wrapper for aries-vcx.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

###########################

I'm eager to submit my application for the mentor position in the Hyperledger - aries-vcx next-gen mobile wrapper programme. I learned about this chance while listening to a YouTube podcast regarding private blockchain, and I was immediately intrigued by the prospect to get knowledge from subject-matter authorities.

I've developed skills in Solidity, JavaScript, Golang, Java, Python, and C++ as a dedicated student of blockchain and web3 technologies. I'm optimistic that I can pick up Rust quickly and construct a rust wrapper around aries-vcx for mobile environments. I have developed a thorough grasp of smart contracts and how they integrate with front-end frameworks like ReactJS and NodeJS through my projects, such as Creator's Fund and Gassless AI NFTs.
<br>
Additionally, I have expertise in a number of tools and technologies that I believe will be helpful for this programme, including Linux, Docker, Bash Scripting, Git/Github, Blockchain, Ethereum, Solana, Hardhat, Chai-testing, ExpressJS, MongoDB/SQL, ERC20, ERC721, GoFiber, and GorillaMux.

I learned about this mentorship programme from a private blockchain-related YouTube podcast, and I'm interested in it because I want to work on developing the uniffi_aries_vcx rust crate and mediator client with support for the Aries message pick-up protocol and gaining practical experience with self-sovereign identity and Aries protocols.
<br>
I intend to gain practical experience with self-sovereign identification and Aries protocols as a mentoree in this programme and to contribute to the creation of the uniffi_aries_vcx rust crate and mediation client with support for the Aries message pick-up protocol.

I am a quick learner and am constantly searching for ways to improve. I have taken part in a number of endeavours and experiences that have improved my abilities and given me a deeper comprehension of the technology. For instance, my team and I created Turban-Onn, an application that uses augmented reality to show turban filters concealing a person's face in real-time, as Grand Finalists in the Smart India Hackathon, Software Edition.
<br>
My knowledge and expertise, in my opinion, qualify me for this mentorship programme. I'm thrilled to have the chance to improve professionally while working with leading professionals in the field and to help create the aries-vcx next-generation mobile wrapper.

I appreciate your taking a look at my application. If it's possible, I'd want to discuss my qualifications and goals in greater detail. Please refer to my résumé for more details about my background and credentials.
