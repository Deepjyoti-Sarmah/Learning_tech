- zero knowledge proof + EVM
	- ### What is EVM
		-  Smart contract (program) --> solc compiler -->Bytecode, ABI
		- Bytecode (low-level insstruction) --> EVM
		-  EVM is decentralized virtual machine that executes smart contracts
		- EVM software-based emulation of a physical computer
	- ### Zero Knowlege proof
		-  A zero-knowledge protocol is a method by which one party can prove to another party that something is true, without reveling any infomation apart from the fact that this specific statement is true
