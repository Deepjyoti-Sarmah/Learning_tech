	- Backend Architechture --> 5 factors to look at
		- Development Experience
			- How easy to refactor, fix bugs & build features?
		- Scalability
			- How many active users/request can be handled?
		- Response Time
			- How does it handle fatal error?
		- Cost
	- Monolith 
		- [[Monolith.excalidraw]]
		- one service does everything
		- development experience
			- simplest architecture
			- easy to run/ test locally
			- fastest way to build, test, and deploy
		- scalability
			- can scale vertically (add memory, CPUs)
			- not feasible to scale horizontally
				- inefficient (Memory overhead, caching)
				- adds infra complexity (load balancer)
		- response time
			- lowest latency
			- no internal network calls
		- reliability
			- single point of  failure
			- if process crashes ---> entire app goes down
				- yes, even with replicas
			- coding practices
		- cost
			- rent virtual server
				- aws ec2, do droplet, heroku app 
			- fixed pricing
			- unutilized processing power
	- microservices
		- [[Microservices.excalidraw]]
		- developer experience
			- strong domain boundaries
			- must jump around the codebase
			- container orchestration (docker , kubernaties) 
			- integration tests are hard
		- scalability
			- Can scale specific services vertically/horizontally
			- Can optimize specific services
		- Response time
			- services communication via internal network calls
			- (De)serialization performance penalty
				- JSON over HTTP (REST)
				- grpc
			- has impact for bigger payloads
		- Reliability
			- failure are isolated (per service)
				- app partially functional
		- cost
			- deploy managed kubernetes cluster
				- AWS EKS, DO Managed K8s, GKE
			- fees: container registry, load  balancers
			- bin packing problem
	- serverless
		- no services, just functions
		- [[Serverless.excalidraw]]
		- Development experience
			- No infrastructure/ architecture --> simple code
			- Runtime limitation (native dependencies)
				- image/pdf conversion 
				- websockets/SSE
			- Security considerations( IP whitelisting)
		- Scalability
			- config memory/ cpu (per functions)
				- 128MB  - 10GB
			- horizontally scales from zero to "infinite"
		- Response Time
			- cold starts (100ms --> 1000 + ms)
				- internet + cold start + func execution time
		- Relibility
			- failure are isolated (per function)
			- no infrastructure
		- Cost 
			- deploy  function to a provider 
				- AWS Lamda, DO Functions, GCP  Cloud Funcs
			- pay per request
				- AWS Lambda
					- $0.20/1M reqs + ~$0.000001/GB-second
