[[Overview of JunoDB - an open source KV store by PayPal]]
- Storage Servers
	- JunoDB stores the data on Storage server <-- where data resides
	- These servers accept the operation and make changes to data
		- They can store the data in-memory or disk
	- JunoDB is not a pure in-mem store
	- Data is split inot partitions (aslo called shards) and each storage server is responsible for a bunch of them
	- [[JunoDB.excalidraw#^uSn7OcjU]]
	- RockerDB Instance
		- Request comes to storage
		- if figures out which shard owns it
		- it writes/reads data from shard
		- [[JunoDB.excalidraw#^f6QO1ndv]]
	- Data ownership
		- we now need to answer which storage server owns which shard?
		- JunoDB uses consistent haashing to ans this
			- minimal data movement
			- truly elastic

	- JunoDB Proxy
		- We have two ways through which client can talk to storage servers
			- client directly talking to ss
			- client talk to proxy which talks to ss
		- JunoDB is a proxy based database
			- abstracts out storage topology from client
			- [[JunoDB.excalidraw#^raIRdYM2]]
		- Advantages
			- storage topology is abstracted
			- client need not connect to all storage server
			- minimal config on clients
		- Is proxy a single machine
			- No Juno can have multiple Juno proxy which can be put behind L..B.
			- overall architecture looks something like
